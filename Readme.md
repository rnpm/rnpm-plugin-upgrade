==========

## Installation

Run the following command from the project you are about to update:

```bash
$ npm install rnpm-plugin-upgrade@0.26 --save-dev
```

where the version is the exactly the same version you are upgrading your React Native to

Available versions:
- `0.26` - upgrades from 0.25 to 0.26

**Note**: Only major & minior versions have to be the same. `rnpm-upgrade` may use patch versions to fix small bugs, so it's advisable to install the last `patch` version available.

## Usage

```bash
$ rnpm upgrade
```
