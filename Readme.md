# Dear friends,

Last November me ([@Kureev](https://github.com/Kureev)) and Mike ([@grabbou](https://github.com/grabbou)) started RNPM. We aimed to bring you a better developer experience and bridge the tooling gap we had back then. Now, as you may know, RNPM is merged into [React Native core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). It means that from now on you don't need to install a third-party software to use your favorite linking functionality (just use a react-native cli). We'd like to say a big "Thank you!" to everybody who supported us, filed new issues, composed PRs and helped us to review them.

Now, when RNPM is a part of React Native, we're going to seal this repository and keep working on React Native tooling inside the core. That said, I kindly ask you to file all new issues / prs in react-native repo and cc us. This repo (and other rnpm plugins) will be a available for a few more months in a read-only mode.

With love, 
Alexey Kureev and Micha≈Ç Grabowski

rnpm upgrade ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rnpm-plugin-upgrade.svg) ![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/rnpm/rnpm-plugin-upgrade.svg)
==========

## Installation

Run the following command from the project you are about to update:

```bash
$ npm install rnpm-plugin-upgrade@0.26 --save-dev
```

where the version is the exactly the same version you are upgrading your React Native to

Available versions:
- `0.26` - upgrades from 0.25 to 0.26

**Note**: Only major & minior versions have to be the same. `rnpm-upgrade` may use patch versions to fix small bugs, so it's advisable to install the last `patch` version available.

## Usage

Automatically performs additional "codemods" for your native projects to adjust to React Native breaking changes.

```bash
$ rnpm upgrade
```
